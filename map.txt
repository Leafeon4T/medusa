~The Organization of Whitewood~
Many countries are members of the Organization of Whitewood, which is intended to protect the security
of nations in the Eastern Plains. This is dependent on the willingness of the other nations of the Org
to actually hold up its ideas. The members of the Organization are varied, and have too many internal
issues to list. In effect, the Org's greatest hamper and greatest strength is spite. As one Maroonier
put it, "The Org is held together by the fact that the only thing they hate more than each other is
everyone else."
